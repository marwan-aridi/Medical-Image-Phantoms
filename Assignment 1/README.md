# COSC 4372 
# Due Date: 9/12/2024


# Introduction 
This project utilizes ellipses with different parameters to produce simulated images that are phantoms used in medical imaging. The images were made by changing the traditional Shepp-Logan phantom. The code is written in MATLAB and creates four different types of phantom images.

# Requirements 
Standard MATLAB functionality, no extra toolboxes needed.

# How to run the code
I have attached only one .m file. The file name is called "assignment1.m" 

To run the code: 
1- Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the asssignment1.m is located 
2- Run the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
assignment1
3-  Output: This will generate and display all four phantom images in separate figure windows.

# File structure 
Code folder that has the assignment1.m file along with requirements.txt file and a PDF report of the assignment. 

# Notes
No external libraries or additional MATLAB toolboxes are required to run the code.
