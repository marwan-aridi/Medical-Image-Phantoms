# Assignment 3
# COSC 4372 
# Due Date: 10/28/2024


# Introduction 
This project focuses on generating MRI simulations using Spin Echo and Gradient Echo methods. The assignment includes verifying MRI signal distributions, simulating T1-weighted images, and understanding MRI generation techniques for both Spin Echo and Gradient Echo images.

# Requirements 
Standard MATLAB functionality, no extra toolboxes needed.


# Important note before running the files!
Ensure that you have correctly located patient1.nii and patient2.nii files, as they are required for the MRI simulations in some scripts. No external libraries or additional MATLAB toolboxes are needed to run the code.

# How to run the code
SpinEcho_1.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where SpinEcho_1.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: SpinEcho_1
Output: This will display the Spin Echo simulation output.

Verifying_Distributions.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Verifying_Distributions.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Verifying_Distributions
Output: This will show MRI signal distribution verifications.

T1_I1.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where T1_I1.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: T1_I1
Output: This will generate a T1-weighted image.

GRE_1.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where GRE_1.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: GRE_1
Output: This will display the Gradient Echo simulation output.

SpinEcho_MRI_Generation.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where SpinEcho_MRI_Generation.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: SpinEcho_MRI_Generation
Output: This will produce and display Spin Echo MRI images.

T1_MRI_Generation.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where T1_MRI_Generation.m is located.
