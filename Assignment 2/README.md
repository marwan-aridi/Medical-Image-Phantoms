# Introduction 
This project involves creating a virtual MRI scanner that simulates MRI images using a modified Shepp-Logan phantom. The assignment focuses on assigning distinct physical properties to tissue compartments and analyzing the effect of scanner parameters on signal intensity in MRI images.

# Requirements 
Standard MATLAB functionality, no extra toolboxes needed.

# How to run the code
1. Plots.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Plots.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Plots
Output: This will generate and display two plots for Q2.3 and Q2.4.

2. Q1_Phantoms.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Q1_Phantoms.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Q1_Phantoms
Output: This will generate and display five output images.

3. Q2_MRI.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Q2_MRI.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Q2_MRI
Output: This will generate and display one output image containing four MRI images.

4. Q2_Phantoms.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Q2_Phantoms.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Q2_Phantoms
Output: This will generate and display one output image containing four MRI phantoms.

5. Q3_Phantoms.m
Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where Q3_Phantoms.m is located.
In the MATLAB Command Window, type: Q3_Phantoms
Output: Three messages will be generated in the MATLAB Command Window. 



# File structure 
Code folder has 5 MATLAB files along with requirements.txt. MATLAB files are: Plots.m, Q3_SSIM.m, Q2_Phantoms.m, Q2_MRI.m, Q1_Phantoms.m



# Notes
No external libraries or additional MATLAB toolboxes are required to run the code.
