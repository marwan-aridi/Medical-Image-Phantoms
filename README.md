# Medical Image Phantoms

This repository contains three projects focused on the generation, analysis, and simulation of medical image phantoms for MRI applications. Each project explores unique aspects of medical imaging, including synthetic phantom creation, signal intensity mapping, and tissue contrast simulation, leveraging MATLAB for implementation.

## Project 1: Shepp-Logan Phantom Generation
### Overview
The first project involves the creation of a Shepp-Logan phantom, a commonly used synthetic model in medical imaging. This phantom provides a standard for testing and calibrating imaging algorithms.

### Key Features
- Generates a Shepp-Logan phantom with specified resolution.
- Simulates gray-level intensities representing different tissue contrasts.
- Outputs a 2D phantom for further analysis.

### Usage
Run the MATLAB script to generate and display the phantom.

## Project 2: Signal Intensity Mapping
### Overview
The second project focuses on signal intensity mapping for MRI simulations. Signal intensity values are computed based on tissue parameters such as T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density (P).

### Key Features
- Computes pixel-by-pixel signal intensities for axial slice images.
- Considers gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters.
- Visualizes results as 2D intensity maps.

### Usage
Use the provided MATLAB script to calculate and plot signal intensity maps for given parameters.

## Project 3: Parameter-Based Imaging Simulation
### Overview
The third project expands upon the previous work by simulating tissue contrasts under various imaging parameters. It demonstrates how changes in parameters like repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) affect MRI contrast.

### Key Features
- Simulates multiple MRI contrast scenarios based on input parameters.
- Provides visualizations for tissue contrast variations.
- Explores the relationship between imaging parameters and tissue visibility.

### Usage
Run the MATLAB script to simulate and visualize parameter-dependent tissue contrasts.
